# Student Performance Prediction

## Problem Statement & Mission
While students enroll in universities with high aspirations, studies indicate that 30-50% of students disengage or drop out before completing their degrees, due to bad influence and a misalignment between their personal goals and their academic pathways. I am on a global mission to empower university students to define and follow through with clear, personalized academic and career goals that genuinely align with their strengths and values using technology.

## Data Used
The dataset (`StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`) contains 13 columns and 6,608 rows: 12 feature columns and 1 target column (`Exam_Score`, 0-100). Features include 4 numerical (Hours_Studied, Attendance, Sleep_Hours, Previous_Scores) and 8 categorical (e.g., Access_to_Resources: [Low, Medium, High], Gender: [Male, Female]) after dropping 7 excluded features (including: Family_Income, Parental_Involvement, Physical_Activity, Distance_from_Home, Motivation_Level, Tutoring_Sessions and Parental_Education_Level).
